# react-app

While comparing Angular 2 vs React, I started by implementing their tutorials, after that I came back and implemented the Heroes app (Agular tutorial) this time in React, after that I decided to grow the app and consume a RESTful web service I created [here](https://github.com/topiltzin-butron/thebride), so now you can have CRUD operations through this app.

## Running the app
1. Run the web app [here](https://github.com/topiltzin-butron/thebride)

Once it is running:
2. Run this app
